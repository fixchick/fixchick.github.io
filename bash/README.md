#  What I learned

I learned how to write simple commands in terminal:
* `cd` for changing directories
* `ls` to show the list of files and folders with
    * `-l` for detailed info about files and folders
    * `-a` for displaying also hidden files and folders and `-A` for the same except `.` and `..`
* `mkdir` for creating new directory
* `rm` for removing files and `-r` option for directories
* `clear` for removing all in terminal
* `chmod` for changing read/write/execute permissions
* `echo` for printing strings and variables
* `cat` for printing file content

Also I touched `nano`, `vim` and `code` commands for text editing.
To exit from `vim` we need to press `Esc` then print `:q!` and press `return`

I wrote a simple bash script.
It always starts with `#!/bin/bash`.
